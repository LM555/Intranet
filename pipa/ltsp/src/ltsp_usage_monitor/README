LTSP usage monitor.

This little program monitors LTSP activity so you can monitor how many
users your LTSP server has. It triggers on mouse movements and assumes,
that user is active, if mouse is moving. This is not necessarily true,
but that's currently not important.

Program is to be run at start of X session.
